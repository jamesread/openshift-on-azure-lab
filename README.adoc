=== Task Description

You are being asked to whiteboard how you, as a Red Hat Partner could create a
**customer offering** around OpenShift on Azure. We'd like you to think about;

* What could this offering look like from a technical perspective?
** eg: Technical Architecture
* What would you, as a Red Hat Partner, do in this offering?
** What skills, experience and resources would you need?
** How can you make margin (money)?
* What is the value to the customer for this offering?

Some examples of offerings to give you ideas;

* A managed AppDev PaaS service based on OCP or ARO
* Consulting service offering around installing OCP on Azure
* A quickstart...

The rules to this are otherwise very open for you to interpret.
